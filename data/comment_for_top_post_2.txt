stolenlogic: The song Rumble by Link Ray is also another Native American hit.
--- SamIwas118: Yes the only banned instrumental
--- --- xratedcheese: &gt;Yes the only banned instrumental

[Library of Congress:](https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/documents/RUMBLE-FINAL.pdf) (PDF)

&gt;Released in April 1958, ‚ÄúRumble‚Äù by Link Wray and His Ray Men was a major hit in the spring and summer in both stores and on jukeboxes--but not on radio. Interestingly, though ‚ÄúRumble‚Äù contained no lyrics, many radio stations banned ‚ÄúRumble‚Äù for its incendiary title. The nation at that time, anxious over sudden spikes in juvenile delinquency, was eager to drum out anything that could be cited as an instigator. Industry charts of the time show that ‚ÄúRumble‚Äù scored just as strongly, if not more so, with young black audiences, as it did with white teenagers, no doubt adding further to the furor.  
&gt;  
&gt;And, true, there is something progressive sounding, envelope-pushing, even a little...dangerous in this musical solo. It‚Äôs been said that it made the guitar sound ‚Äúdirty.‚Äù And, frankly, it‚Äôs hard to argue. Meanwhile, the repeated climbing scales within the work do create an eager anticipation. It‚Äôs an escalation that can drive a listener to a frenzy of un-exorcised excitement. Did adult authorities at the time of ‚ÄúRumble‚Äôs‚Äù release fear what the youth of America might be inspired to do by this wild music?  
&gt;  
&gt;Furthermore, the incorporation of sound distortion within the track‚Äîwhich would lay the groundwork for a million punk and metal works to come‚Äîmade ‚ÄúRumble‚Äù incredibly anti-establishment. What is more rebellious than when the music is turned back on itself?
--- --- -Ken-Tremendous-: Wild. Authorities feared an instrumental would incite violence. *That's* how good it is.
--- --- --- Vermilion: Reminds me of the [Ghost Dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Dance) history that Native Americans are credited for using that lead to military resistance.
--- --- --- 1ncorrect: I thought it was banned because "Rumble" was a slang term for gang violence. But I can also see that being a convenient excuse to suppress a Native artist.
--- --- --- --- PirateVikingNinja: I'd wonder if the people doing the censoring even knew though. It was apparently pretty big in those days to hide one's native heritage pretty deep. I've read some interviews of Aaron Carey (the brains behind native-themed black metal band Nechochwen), and he talks at length about how he had to do a lot of digging to find out about his own family's (Shawnee and Lenape) roots.

It's a good thing we live in a better time for musical expression of one's ancestry, because Nechochwen's new album kicks so much ass it would be a crime to deprive the world of it.
--- --- --- --- --- Nexusv3: I haven't heard of Nechochwen, but I'm definitely checking out Kanawha Black asap. if you know of any other native metal I'd love to hear about em! Blackbraid has been on of my top albums this year.
--- --- --- --- --- --- PirateVikingNinja: Well not to be "that" guy, but to a lot of people I know, Blackbraid is seen as kind of the watered-down version of native black metal. For me though, if they get people into the scene in general, they're doing good work. That said, though, it's a thriving scene with a number of awesome bands.

So obviously there's Nechochwen, who are my favorite for their/Aaron's sheerly mind-boggling musicianship and songwriting ability, plus the fact that the themes are focused on peoples of the eastern woodlands, and thus the closest thing to "local folk metal" as one can get on the eastern seaboard of the US.

Pan-Amerikan Native Front are another one that are more straightforward black metal. They're what Blackbraid modeled themselves most strongly after, if I had to guess.

And then if you set your sights outside of just North America, there are a bunch. Just to name a few, there's...

Xibalba (the Mexico City one), who are black metal with heavily Mayan themes

Yaotl Mictlan (from Mexico, but since relocated to Utah) also black metal with a strong folk element and more Nahuan peoples (Aztec) themes lyrically and instrumentally. Their album Sagrada Tierra del Jaguar goes unbelievably hard.

and Tzompantli, the death-doom project of the main guy from the other band called Xibalba (the death metal/hardcore one that's also Mexican but based out of San Diego), whose newest album, Tlazcaltiliztli, is full of folky goodness and among my favorite releases so far this year.
--- --- --- --- --- SpiritualBar2469: Umm no not hide it. It was literally illegal to dance, worship or speak our native tongues. Or for that matter raise our own children. They stole children by the tens of thousands. These laws changed in the 70s, 80s and 90s. The surpreme court is expected to overturn IWCA in a couple of weeks. 

White people are still committing genocide against natives
--- --- --- --- --- --- PirateVikingNinja: Yes, there you go. Sorry, I was speaking mostly to things I've read from people of the eastern seaboard who grew up in the '70s. Hopefully your comment gets more visibility than some guy like me who just wants to talk about music, but isn't speaking from a place of actually having native heritage myself.

For as much as modern North American societies talk a big game about racial equality, you're absolutely right, the people who were here first are too often forgotten.

Here's hoping for the sake of the world that those women-hating criminals in black robes fail to take away any more of the rights of you or your relatives.
--- --- --- --- IHeartPallets: That might have to do with it a good bit but story I‚Äôve always heard is that they were literally afraid the instrumental would incite violence
--- --- --- --- Little_Village_1367: The music industry sure doesn‚Äôt have any issue with gang violence these days
--- --- --- --- --- 1ncorrect: I mean they do. Have you never heard a radio edit of a song before?
--- benefit_of_mrkite: Link Wray was incredible
--- --- MurderDoneRight: Love his work with Robert Gordon. But my favorite line-up is still with Danny Gatton on guitar, man that guy shreds!
--- --- --- mosi_moose: Danny Gatton and Link Wray = 2 absolute beasts
--- --- thatbusydaddy: He would poke holes in his amp speaker to get more growl in his tone. That sound is iconic.
--- Link50L: &gt;The song Rumble by Link Ray is also another Native American hit.

Nice catch. I've been a huge Link Wray fan for decades and decades, since the 80s. Broke my heart that my girlfriend at the time noted to me that he had played a local pub only a night or two before and I missed seeing him live. He passed away only a week or two later. Very sad.
--- Legomaster1289: I FUCK THE MUUUSIC
--- pinkbanananaz: [if your interested in learning more about the subject!](https://www.rumblethemovie.com/about)
--- munchnerk: Link is a little complicated in the Native music scene - basically he claimed his mother had Shawnee ancestry, but the Shawnee tribe has no record in its rolls of his mother's family. Tribal records are surprisingly meticulous, partly because the federal government's forced removal of Native communities forced them to be - and it wasn't uncommon for non-Native residents of the southeastern US to claim tribally specific indigenous ancestry for various reasons. And if your parent or grandparent proudly proclaims it, it's really easy to pass that down as unquestioned fact. Not a malicious thing, just a common thing that happened. It's complicated here because Link identified publicly with it, but didn't really connect to or support the broader Shawnee community while claiming and profiting from that public identity.

Shawnee tribal leaders today have been trying to publicly challenge that claim - not because it invalidates Link as an incredible musician, but that this element of passed-down and mistaken identity is a common aspect of impoverished lives in the southeastern US through the early 20th century. A lot of people still repeat their family's myth of native origin today! And while Link's story is incredible and he is a righteously revered musician, claiming Native ancestry and having it (and engaging with your community) are totally different things. As far as I can tell, Shawnee tribal leadership don't claim Link Wray as a Shawnee, and would see him held as an example of this kind of confusion. However, the Shawnee tribe doesn't have a huge voice compared to the massive influence of Link Wray's body of work and his estate, and the idea of a Shawnee rock 'n' roller is sexy, so the myth rolls on. 

So yeah. Redbone, fuck yes Native rock band. Link Wray, fuck yeah killer guitarist, sort of complicated dude culturally!
--- --- weedful_things: You mean my ex-wife's grandmother might not be an Indian Princess?
--- --- --- Sangxero: Nonsense! All white Americans have a grandmother who's an Indian princess!
--- --- --- --- weedful_things: I have three of them! On each side of my family!
--- reecewagner: *Are you Link Wray?*


Who wants to know
--- Sissyneck1221: Good god Rumble is such a heavy jam. It is Link Wray though, not to be that guy‚Ä¶..
--- Bandit1379: Link Wray*

I assume that was autocorrect messing with ya.
nah-meh-stay: I remember seeing them on midnight special

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0drevGOgA
--- BIGD0G29585: Complete with a Fancy Dancer/Rhythm Guitar player. This song has such a cool ‚Äò70s vibe.
--- --- Mr_Wut8794: The dancer is actually the lead guitar! The singer is playing rhythm üòÅ
--- Typingpool: This is also a great song of theirs!

https://youtu.be/Oxibgkb3RFY
--- --- aspidities_87: Yeah truly if you don‚Äôt know ‚ÄòThe Witch Queen of New Orleans‚Äô you need to click this link. It‚Äôs a goddamn banger, as the kids say.
--- --- WolfCola4: I had a feeling it would be this one! Great band
gman1951: Blackfoot another great Native American band of the 70's.
--- Algaean: Neat, thanks, i love a good music recommendation
--- benefit_of_mrkite: Blackfoot is a great band.  A more modern one is the band indigenous
--- shempaholic: Their first album (No Reservations) is not very well known and was out of print for many years. Check it out, it's really good: https://youtu.be/xTdQkKpr98Q
cafefutbolista: If you‚Äôre curious about the Native American influence of rock and roll, you should check out the documentary ‚ÄúRumble‚Äù on Netflix.
--- dacotahd: That documentary made me learn "Rumble" on guitar. Its not difficult but MAN it just sings to the soul. I'm 2nd gen off the rez (i want to change my last name back its ancesteral name "iron eye") like it was before it was changed in an native conversion school/camp.

Crazy to think Natives actually pretended to be other races to avoid further racism.
--- --- Uhhhhh55: I mean fuck bud iron eye is a sick last name

And native American culture needs all the representation it can get
--- --- --- unclecaveman1: ‚ÄúHi I‚Äôm John Fuck-Bud-Iron-Eye.‚Äù

You‚Äôre right. Very badass.
--- --- --- davedegen: Right ? If I could have iron eye as my last name I would in a heartbeat. Definitely cooler than my ‚ÄúUkrainian misspelled by border guard‚Äù last name
--- HeyJoe459: Someone else commenting this makes me so happy. I got goosebumps when the native woman started singing along with the old Charley Patton recordings. That documentary is eye opening musically and culturally.
--- --- amy_amy_bobamy: Aren‚Äôt those women amazing?  I get chills remembering how they sound.   Powerful.  

That documentary was excellent. I learned so much.
Robcobes: Their song about Wounded Knee wasn't even allowed to be printed in the US. Became a hit in Europe though.

Edit: it was allowed to be printed and played in the US. Their own label only refused to.
--- Black_irises: Glad you mentioned this. Just [looked it up](https://youtu.be/AvZbmLJlSoM) and it's an incredibly powerful song.
--- --- Spiffy313: Thank you for sharing this.  Shocking that it was censored here in the US, but also not shocking at all. üòû
--- Painkiller90: "We were all wounded at wounded knee"
--- MaxTransferspeed: Yes I'm from Europe, and I remember their song Wounded Knee being a hit in the Netherlands, somewhere in the 70's. I was a child and I heard for the first time about the position of the Native Americans in the US.
--- --- Drunkdoggie: I'm Dutch and I vaguely remember this song being a hit here. Back in the early naughts it was sometimes played on the oldies station.

My dad used to sing it sometimes while doing chores around the house, but I haven't heard the actual song in years.
--- HeyItsMeBender: That‚Äôs wild! Why? I assume it‚Äôs some kind of political thing
--- --- TheVandyyMan: It was allowed to be printed in the US and indeed was. It just wasn‚Äôt played on radio stations or widely distributed because it was seen as controversial and the companies didn‚Äôt want to take on the risk. No laws prevented it from being distributed or played though.
BillyWolf2014: "‚ÄúJimi [Hendrix] stated that Lolly Vegas was the best guitarist he had ever heard and suggested that they create a band. Knowing they were Native Americans, Jimi suggested a name that reflected their roots. Thus, came the name ‚ÄúRedbone‚Äù, a Cajun term for a mixed-race person.‚Äù"
--- lilbitpetty: I am Native and our Medicine wheel shows 4 races, the four directions and so on. White, Red, Yellow, and Black. We Natives are the red men/women. Red to the bone I have heard many times on the res, hence Red Bone aka honors the ways of our ancestors..
--- experienceenrollee: There should be a wiki entry for every guitarist that is rumoured to have been named by Jimi Hendrix as the greatest guitarist he has ever seen. I can think of Rory Gallagher and Terry Kath but am sure there are many others.
--- --- NoSirThatsPaper: I heard Jimi Hendrix saw Buckethead on YouTube and was so impressed he only ate at KFC after that.
--- --- DrMuchRespect: Phil Keaggy. Or so the sound guy at a church I used to work at says. Funny how the guitarist named is usually a favorite of the person telling the story.
--- --- --- UnluckyHorseman: I heard the same at the church I grew up in. Probably no coincidence since Keaggy is Christian.
--- moeburn: Yeah they were "redbones" themselves - half Mexican, half Native American.
--- --- HiILikePlants: Earlier in their career, they were told to change their name from Vasquez brothers to Vegas brothers which helped them play more shows at the time
grondin: I learned this from "Reservation Dogs"
--- MahjongNucleus: "You kids need to stop being shitasses."
--- --- duaneap: I want to yell like the Spirit Guide yells.
--- --- --- Georgeisthecoolest: Find a nice crowded place and practise.
--- --- --- --- duaneap: It‚Äôs the only way to know if it works! A-ho!
--- sig_pistols: It's an old snaggin song!
--- RadioMill: Skoden
--- --- 405freeway: Stoodis.
--- --- --- Dark_Avenger666: Sup white jesus?
--- --- --- --- alichoturqo: Haha she‚Äôs the best character I‚Äôve seen in a show in a long while.
--- --- --- VanDammesKiai: Gwanden
--- --- WhyIHateTheInternet: Growing up in Oklahoma we always said this but I never knew why until this show came out lol.
--- frothy_pissington: Hands down the best show of the last couple years.

[And the Deer Lady episode where they used Redbone was the first great episode ....](https://www.vulture.com/article/reservation-dogs-recap-season-one-episode-5.html)

That episode is where they really started zooming in on specific characters, getting surreal, and hitting some deeper emotional shit.
--- --- Shonuff8: I enjoyed S2 even more than S1. It expands out to focus on more of the residents in the reservation. Cheese‚Äôs episode in particular was incredible and heartbreaking
--- --- --- aspidities_87: Cheese‚Äôs episode was one of the best, I love him. And Willy Jack‚Äôs episode too, but in Cheese‚Äôs we get the best line: 

‚ÄòHey do you mind if I insult you while you‚Äôre taking me away?‚Äô 

‚ÄòSure just don‚Äôt make it too personal.‚Äô 

‚ÄòThis guy‚Äôs a child molester!‚Äô 

‚ÄòJESUS FUCK!‚Äô
--- --- --- --- friggintodd: ACAD!
--- --- --- --- Lankybonesjones: Every season needs a Cheese episode!
--- --- --- frothy_pissington: Yes.

And.

How about when Willie Jack and her dad go hunting in season one?

Whew..... so much in such a little two person episode.

The writing and acting is quirky, deep, genuine, and perfect for the show.
--- --- --- --- UGoBoy: Yeah, it was an emotional episode.

Then the Rich Texans rolled through and had me cracking up.

"AND DON'T FORGET THE GAYS!"
--- --- --- Beezo514: Cheese is my favorite. I love his obsession with 80s movies and his quiet introspection. only thing I wished we saw more of in S2 was Cheese and Uncle Brownie hanging out in his cabin.
--- --- --- --- BurnerAcctNo1: Cheese and Willie Jack are the best but I think we‚Äôre more likely to see Elora and Bear everywhere in the future.
--- --- --- --- vbfischer: My pronouns are..
--- --- trillhungyboy: Reservation Dogs is the best thing on TV in a while

in my opinion at least
--- --- --- wavemango23: Greasy fry bread greasy greasy fry bread
--- --- aspidities_87: I love Deer Lady. I know out here in the PNW, our native folks tell a similar story about a vengeful woman but she‚Äôs Beaver Lady, and has a big thick tail. Sometimes she gets together with Porcupine to trick Coyote into humiliating himself by getting quills stuck in his dick. 

I‚Äôm so glad to see a show that gets these native legends right, and shows their spirit people as‚Ä¶.well, people. Because they are! That‚Äôs the whole point. They can be vindictive, kind, mischievous, stupid and horny, and sometimes all at once.
--- --- --- frothy_pissington: I‚Äôm a nearly 60yr old, white dude from Ohio, and Reservation Dogs hits home so often.

It‚Äôs a very different cast and world than we are normally shown.

The characters ALL ring true in their episodes.

The humor and surreal shit are fantastic.

There is so much universal emotion and meaning in a lot of moments.

I‚Äôve been genuinely moved numerous times watching the show......
--- --- --- --- Substantial-Emu-9900: White but mostly grew up in New Mexico. Every single cast member, but especially Willie, reminds me of someone I was friends with in high school and has really made me miss people I hadn't thought about in almost 20 years. It's an incredible show,
--- --- --- CPower2012: My friend worked in Northern Canada for a few years and he heard stories about a deer lady up there. He was blown away when he watched that episode.
--- --- --- --- motivaction: The lady who plays Deerlady is from Canada: Kaniehtiio Horn. The owl at uncle's house with covered eyes is cool too.
--- --- molotov_cockteaze: Oh man, I really need to get on this show.
--- --- --- hungry4danish: Just don't go into it expecting it to be a full-on comedy and it's more enjoyable.
--- --- --- --- megalurkeruygcxrtgbn: I've compared it to Atlanta for the mix of surrealism, cultural relevance and comedy. A little lighter/more optimistic in tone than Atlanta though, there's nornally a positive resolution to stuff the characters go through.
--- --- --- --- --- AndronicustheGreat: There are some references to Atlanta placed throughout the show. Like in the first season when the characters are at IHS and keep saying "I hate this place", definitely was a reference to the Atlanta episode where they get booked in jail.
--- --- --- frothy_pissington: Give it time.

First four episodes are good but are also setting the scene and the characters....

Episode 5 narrows the focus, deepens the characters, and shows you where they are going creatively with the show.

From there on out you should be invested.

If you don‚Äôt get a little verklept when Willie Jack and her dad go deer hunting ...
--- --- Scruff: For those who don‚Äôt know, all of the supernatural characters and events in the show are based around actual Native American mythology. They don‚Äôt explain much and leave the research to the viewer. It‚Äôs very fun and interesting reading up on this stuff after episodes.

Here is the Deer Lady‚Äôs Wikipedia:

--- Thrilling1031: Do you stream it? What service is it on?
--- --- balognasoda: Hulu
--- --- --- Thrilling1031: Thank you.
--- --- Ok_Preparation8239: For Canadians, it's on Disney+
--- --- hannibal218: You can find it on Hulu! They‚Äôve got 2 seasons out so far.
--- --- --- Thrilling1031: Thank you.
--- --- aspidities_87: Hulu has it but it‚Äôs on FX.
--- --- --- Beezo514: it's actually now hulu exclusive after S1. I'm just glad they're still making it. easily one of the best shows being made and so great hearing native stories from native people.
--- --- --- Thrilling1031: Thank you.
--- --- monkeyhog: Hulu
--- --- --- Thrilling1031: Thank you.
--- -Ken-Tremendous-: It's organtic
--- --- 405freeway: Big is a treasure.
--- SunOnTheInside: [If you‚Äôre not sure if you should watch this show, you need to see William Knifeman](https://youtu.be/uDinLERiF4A)
--- Notpan: Such a hilarious and just comforting show. Watching it feels like having a cup of hot cocoa in my lap and a soft warm blanket around me.
--- --- ReyRey5280: For real, the irreverent tone on heavy issues that boil down to the actual importance of not being a shitass is fucking great.
slfnflctd: It's also the theme song on F is for Family.  Which, despite it's title, is not really a family show (although it is about one).  Semi-accurate portrayal of a dysfunctional 70s household &amp; their neighborhood, from what I've been told.
--- TheClayroo: It's Bill Burr basically recreating his childhood with his emotionally abusive father.
--- --- Cavalleria-rusticana: &gt;his emotionally abusive father.

That explains *a lot* about Burr's personality..
--- --- --- stickdudeseven: "Honey, how many childhood stories do I have to tell you before you follow the bread crumbs to the psycho that you married?"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=810qddPcsqo
--- --- --- --- yoortyyo: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs not that she says I‚Äôm a jerk, its that she has the nerve to be surprised‚Äù.
--- --- --- --- TroubleshootenSOB: Love this clip. The tuna sandwich up the ass part haha
--- --- --- TheClayroo: He tells a famous story in one of his early stand ups about his dad calling him a girl leading up to Christmas and then getting just a doll on Christmas morning. That shit is pure evil.
--- --- --- --- Banshu: My dad told me and brother he was getting us gameboys for christmas and then got us little plastic ones full of gummy candies shaped like popular chatacters! Go dad!
--- --- --- --- --- PhilxBefore: Y'all just misheard him. He held true to his promise of getting you guys GummyBois
--- --- --- --- --- LeoPriestley: One time my dad got blackout drunk and fell on a campfire, and eleven year old me had to roll him off of it.

Is that one?
--- --- --- --- --- --- herecomestheD: I guess but like damn I'm sorry ü´§
--- --- --- --- --- EmmBee27: I remember those things too, I almost didn't want to eat them because I thought the 3D gummy characters looked cool lol
--- --- --- --- --- Gekokapowco: Disappointing your children for a laugh, classic dad move!

Unfortunately
--- --- --- --- KeystoneKops: What's super interesting is how he tells that story through the years!

In 2003, getting understandably emotional and sort of chocked up with the humiliation of the memory :  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=S8Ho1WWDECM&amp;feature=emb_logo

But in his 2019 special Paper Tiger, he tells the story with utmost hilarity and irreverence, you can really see that he had to grapple with his demons through the years and can face them with a lot less pain now
--- --- --- --- PowerSword: Love the story where his younger brother didn't want to eat his leftover dinner for breakfast, their mum said he couldn't have waffles like the rest of the family, the brother says ohh mum I hate you, and their dad took a full glass of milk and swilled it right in the kids face. 

Funny stories but not healthy.
--- --- --- --- --- ext_999: love the story of him not seeing Star Wars when it came out, he had no idea about this huge movie that every kid saw like 8 times over the summer. It got to the point where he had like a mini personal grudge against the franchise, and he would go off on "nerd culture" in his stand ups and podcast...and now he's part of the franchise.
--- --- --- --- --- --- mofugginrob: Had one of the best parts in The Mandalorian.
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- ext_999: for what it's worth I have a hard time with him as an actor cause he's still Bill Burr to me, like in Breaking Bad and some movies, but kudos to him for making a name for himself.
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- mofugginrob: I get that. He does have a presence that doesn't blend in well. He did a really good job with that role, though.
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- _i_just_blue_myself: To circle this back to the title of the post, he's very good in the show reservation dogs. ( A character in the show explains redbone the band to a young native kid.)
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- Historical-Tree-1139: I'd bet money that this show is the reason this post was made in the first place lol
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- mickroo: He literally kickstarted his career as a comedy actor though. His role in Chappelle's Show skits are legendary!
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ChwatBot: He fit pretty well in The King of Staten Island. I get what you mean though. Any time I see him cameo in a movie the first thing that comes to mind is ‚ÄúOh look, it‚Äôs Bill Burr!‚Äù
--- --- --- --- --- gynoceros: Swill means to rinse or to drink. For next time.
--- --- --- Robot_Basilisk: One of his most recent specials has a touching moment in it where he recounts getting mad at a new toaster for requiring a smartphone connection. After he yells at it, his young daughter runs in saying, "I'm sorry daddy!" and it breaks his heart.

He says that kicked off a lot of self-reflection and introspection about himself and how he was raised and led to him getting sober and working on anger management and relationship issues.

I highly recommend watching it because he goes into a lot more detail, but I don't remember which of his... 50 recent specials it was on.
--- --- --- --- TheDarkAbove: Live at Red Rock is the latest one, probably from that.
--- --- Hotpocket1515: He does claim that frank is really a conglomeration of all the writers rooms Dads in the 70s, they were all like that apparently lmao
--- --- --- Hereslookingatmekid: It makes sense. My dad grew up in the 70s and his dad sounds *much* nicer (he died when my dad was a teenager so I never met him), but a lot of his friends‚Äô dads growing up sound a lot like Frank. 

I do think Frank was a good character beyond just a verbally abusive dick, because you can tell all his major issues stem from trauma over the way he was treated. He *wants* to be better and is better than his own dad, but he doesn‚Äôt know how to and is too proud to seek help.
--- --- _Im_Dad: I liked that show..

Edit: I watched the 5 seasons and I'm simply stating I liked the show. Why do people insist on looking for subliminal messages.
--- --- --- TheClayroo: Ya it's great. Bill is my favourite.
--- --- --- CrabsolutelyBullshit: Comment: "I liked this show"

Reddit: "and I took that personally"
--- --- --- NativeMasshole: I liked it in the beginning, but it got too repetitive and depressing for me eventually.
--- --- --- --- LOUCIFER_315: Such is life
--- --- --- --- Chaminade64: So does Reddit.
--- --- --- --- kia75: That's the sad part about shows like "F is for Family".  You want the dad to complete his journey and become a good father, and the family to become functional, but that's not real life.  For the show to continue while still being funny, the Father and family have to remain dysfunctional.  IRL, the father never really acknowledges his shortcomings or changes much, just got older and Burr had to come to terms with who his father is, dysfunctions and all.
--- AdmiralGrayBush: And you know what‚Ä¶ and you know what‚Ä¶
--- --- aspidities_87: EAT THAT NASTY PUSSY
--- aaronrandango2: It's a good show, and if you grew up in the 70s it's extremely relatable
--- --- Drakea89: My father was a pre teen/teenager growing up in the 70‚Äôs. We watched the first episode together. When it was done he said he didn‚Äôt want to watch anymore because he didn‚Äôt want to relive his childhood.
--- --- --- ak47oz: Damn lol
--- --- --- m1thrand1r__: Oof my mom too ‚ò†Ô∏è She thought it was funny but hit waaaaay too close to home to keep watching
--- --- Strong-Inflation-776: Grew up in the 80‚Äôs and it still hits close to home.
--- --- --- randyfox: Same. Early to mid 80s wasn‚Äôt as dissimilar to the mid to late 70s as movies and many TV shows would have people think. Sure there was new wave and the infancy to the digital age, but there was still a lot of earth tones, a lack of adult supervision, and dysfunctional families everywhere.
--- --- --- --- UnnecessaryPeriod: Lack of adult supervision is what really got me.  I call my brother (in his 40's) from time to time and ask if that shit really happened.  

Like a Christmas where me and the cousins (maybe 10 or 12 at the time) really slid down that culvert to a 20ft drop-off that we had to stop to not die.  All while they were drinking and smoking in the house maybe 3 miles away.  80s were crazy man
--- --- --- --- --- PhilxBefore: I wasn't born until 85, but before smartphones or even the turn of the century, shit was all honor system, be home when the street lights come on, wild West every kid for himself type dealio
--- --- --- --- --- KmartQuality: Lead gas fumes in the air will do that to a family and society
--- --- --- --- Girlsontheinternet: I feel like Stranger Things really does a great job of capturing all of this. The show starts off as very 70s with the earth tones, especially in small towns and in poorer homes who live about a decade behind anyway. Then in the 3rd season, everything gets a bit more neon 80s, but it's still primarily for people with more money (the Wheelers). Poorer families (the Byers) keep the orange tones and wood paneling for a LONG time. It does seem like the further we get into the mid 80s, the more the show brings in those classic 80s styles.
--- --- --- --- mathazar: 80s poor = 70s basically. I grew up in the 80s with a black and white TV, an old car and second hand clothes.
--- --- --- --- aspidities_87: Yeah my sister was born in 71 and was a little too young for the bulk of the show‚Äôs timeline but everything she described from her childhood was similar. Go play outside until the streetlights come on, and don‚Äôt go near the weirdo down the block, etc.
--- --- --- --- --- mangongo: Streetlight thing was still a thing in the 90's too. Be back by dark, don't go past the fence by highway, but if you do make sure you bring me back a coffee from Tims.
--- --- --- --- --- Ragin_Bacon: Up until the mid eighties things were crazy. Halloween didn't start till nightfall groups of kids unescorted going door to door and in some cases into the houses. Heck the other day I mentioned to a friend about getting a ride from the river back to my buddies house. They had an old Landover and we just packed in so much we had 2 fellas hanging on to the back. Reckless and dangerous sure but it was a different time.
--- --- --- --- turdmachine: Depends how poor you were. If you grew up poor in the eighties, you were basically still in the seventies
--- molotov_cockteaze: I fucking love that show. I‚Äôm big into cartoons and I would put F is for Family in my top ten.
--- --- Brando_Fett: Hard agree. It‚Äôs great!
--- Soup-Wizard: I‚Äôve heard people say they can‚Äôt watch it because they grew up in an abusive household and it‚Äôs a trigger.
--- TroubleshootenSOB: Ah, Ole Billy Blue Balls' show. I'm a fan
--- MightyCaseyStruckOut: Don't make me put you through that fucking wall!
--- --- 67Mustang-Man: So help me God, if I started building walls today, and don't stop for the next 10 years, there still wouldn't be enough of em FOR ME TO FUCKIN PUT YOU THROUGH
--- ComradeJohnS: There‚Äôs too much screaming and anger in the show to rewatch often like Futurama, but I like F is for Family.  lol
FireWireBestWire: Repopularized, lol. It's been played on classic rock stations for years.  
Edit. Folks, repopularized implies that it was popular, became unpopular, and then became hugely popular again. This song never left radio playtime, and it's not like it made the top 40 again.
--- DrSpaceman4: And like, dozens of commercials
--- --- Traditional_Entry183: I still associate it with Match.com
--- ImpossibleParfait: Haha yeah this song was a hugeeeee hit for a very long time.
--- --- MiggeldyMackDaddy: And still is
--- shirubakun: F is for family
--- Libruhh: It definitely received a massive spike in interest when the movie came out: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%2Fg%2F11dfx_rkd0
HomerNarr: Redbone?

The witch queen of New Orleans 

Uncle got me as kid ‚Äúyou must listen to this‚Ä¶‚Äù
Got me, never forgot.

Edit: Halloween!
--- CurlSagan: Redbone is such a "My uncle introduced me to this band" sort of band. I can picture the record sleeves in my mind.
--- PlatosCaveSlave: Such a killer tune!!
LOUCIFER_315: It's an old snagging song
--- SuperSacredWarsRoach: Big remembers
--- --- aspidities_87: AHO!
byronicrob: I'm a  Mohawk Indian and didn't know this till I was in my thirties.. and now when you listen to it you can hear the native influence, slight accents..
Brian1326: Also part of probably the best commercial ever.

https://youtu.be/6PH88aAL7hU
CurlSagan: I also recommend the song [Maggie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s91hvRs3_SY) for people not familiar with Redbone.
--- burgerking4: Yes! Maggie is my favorite RB song, but since you took that one, I‚Äôll suggest ‚ÄúWovoka‚Äù
Texas-Republic: Wow! TIL learned that this song was not performed by a black group! I seriously thought it was done a popular black group of the 70s of whom I didn‚Äôt know the name of.
Kerbonaut2019: ‚Äúrepopularized by ‚ÄòGuardians of the Galaxy‚Äô‚Äù is a weird way of saying that it‚Äôs always been popular, but was just discovered by nerds
d33roq: Native Americans play a huge role in the history of rock &amp; roll.  
Buffy St Marie is Cree.   
Link Wray was Shawnee  
Elvis was part Cherokee, as was Jimi Hendrix.
--- CretaMaltaKano: Robbie Robertson is Mohawk.
SeanyDay: Someone started watching Rez Dogs
jonjonesjohnson: LOL, seeing this while I'm listening to Ole Billy Red Nuts' podcast
--- JohnnyVNCR: Just checking in how are ya
Dr_Edge_ATX: If you're interested in Native American influence on American music you should check out the documentary Rumble: The Indians Who Rocked the World. Just a great film with so much interesting history, and obviously sad history of people not getting their dues because of racism. 

The guitarist Link Wray was actually big before Redbone too. He came up with that iconic riff used in Pulp Fiction, not for the movie specifically but was a hit song from the 50s.
viktorbir: When I was a kid we had quite a few of their records at home (in Catalonia). We Catalans always felt identified with Indians on all Western films. I mean, we had been losing all wars since mid 17th century and our language and laws had been forbidden.

Here some of my preferred songs:

* [We were all wounded at Wounded Knee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvZbmLJlSoM), a fight, reivindicative, song.
* [Witch queen of New Orleans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oxibgkb3RFY), this sounded scary, to me.
* [One more time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sLPiasQgGE), a more poppy, happy one.
* [Maggie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDcuPF1CWI), as a kid I liked the ¬´boom boom¬ª and the ¬´shi shi¬ª ;-)
* [Chant 13th hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAxaTMVW1f0), this was on the B side of some single I think. The first minute or two is quite hard to swallow, but then it gets easy. As a kid I enjoyed the first part. 
* [Wovoka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiHWbU2oFP0), I don't remember having this at home as a kid, but it's a good one about an Indian profit from the 19th century and the Ghost Dance.
distant-starlight: There's a graphic novel available about them, too.
UrbanGM: Always glad when someone discovers them and their history. Enjoy!
Impossible-Web740: And now that song is going to be stuck in my head all day, not that I'm complaining.
